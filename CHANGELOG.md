### **(V.3.3.1 Changes) (1.17.1 Minecraft)**

##### Entities:
Beehemoth will now stay still when crouch right-clicked like how you make dogs and cats sit.

To feed Beehemoth, just right click while holding any honey feeding item. No crouching needed.

##### Advancements:
Added new advancements for this mod to add some progression and high xp rewards!
 Note: Progress or conditions met before this update will not contribute towards the new advancements.

Fixed Honey Slime not giving Honey Bottle when harvested with Glass Bottle.

Honey Slimes have a bit more health, a bit more attack power, and will jump faster and higher when angry as well as stay angry longer.

 Before, it was the child that had this feature instead of the adult by mistake.

Fixed issue where trying to remove Pollen Puff from bees causes some logspam.

Fixed using items on Bees/Honey Slime may cause the item's use to continue pass the entity. 
 Such as feeding bees a Honey Bucket will place honey behind the entity at well.
