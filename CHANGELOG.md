### **(V.6.7.34 Changes) (1.19.2 Minecraft)**

##### Effects:
Reduced amount of effect applying Wrath of the Hive does to bees. This will give a significant performance improvement for modpacks
 that have mods that are doing expensive checks on effect applying.


### **(V.6.7.33 Changes) (1.19.2 Minecraft)**

##### Blocks:
Fixed Crystalline Flower able to break above blocks. Now you cannot place flower down if there are obstructions.


### **(V.6.7.32 Changes) (1.19.2 Minecraft)**

##### Blocks:
Changed the display name of Incense Candle to Potion Candle as that's a better name. 
 Registry name is unaffected so it is still `the_bumblezone:incense_candle`. 
 That way you won't lose this item/block on updating to this version of Bumblezone. (1.20.1 will update registry name)

##### Advancements:
Changed honey_compass_recipe advancement to trigger if one obtains a Honey Compass item. Doesn't need to only be crafted now.

Added obtain_throne_honey_compass advancement to get people to explore Cell maze structure a bit more for the Throne Honey Compass.

Moved Queen's Desire advancement-line to start after obtain_throne_honey_compass advancement. Progress you made towards Queen's Desire is not lost.

Applied glint effect to some advancement's icons.

Changed order of Super/Potion Candle advancements and now allow the light_soul_incense_candle advancement to be triggered by Super Candles as well.
