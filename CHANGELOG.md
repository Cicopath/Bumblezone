### **(V.4.3.0 Changes) (1.18.1 Minecraft)**

##### Blocks:
Fixed some honey filled blocks not consuming Glass Bottles when collecting Honey Bottles from the blocks.

##### Effects:
Protection of the Hive will no longer be removed when taking honey from blocks picking up/mining various honey blocks.
 HOWEVER, hitting a bee or mining/taking honey from Honeycomb Brood Blocks will still remove Protection of the Hive.
