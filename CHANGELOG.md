### **(V.7.2.3 Changes) (1.20.1 Minecraft)**

##### Bee Aggression:
Spider/Bear-like entities that are OwnableEntities that spawn into Bumblezone's dimension will not get attacked right away if the entity is owned by a player.

##### Entities:
Hardcoded Bee Queen to "catch" Snowballs thrown at it if snowballs is a valid Bee Queen trade. Will not work for other projectiles.

Beehemoth will not lose friendship if hurt while untamed.

##### Mod Compat:
Passed owner of thrown Pollen Puff to FakePlayers so claim owners can throw Pollen Puff to place blocks in their own claims.

(Forge): Updated compat with Ars Nouveau. Ars must now be 4.9.0 or newer if you have that mod on.
