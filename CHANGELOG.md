### **(V.6.3.0 Changes) (1.19.2 Minecraft)**

##### Blocks:
Fixed Glistering Honey Crystal not dropping itself when mined with Silk Touch.

Improved Glistering Honey Crystal's sparkling so it can appear anywhere on the block instead of just the corners.

Improved Glistering Honey Crystal's sparkling to use a new animated particle texture now.

Fixed unsuccessful lighting of Super Candles/Incense Candles still damaging/consuming the lighting item used by the player.

Added Crystalline Flower block!
 Spawns in the new Hanging Garden structure!
 Right click it to open up a GUI where you can grow the plant by giving it you XP or stacks of items to consume. Grows up to 7 blocks (tiers) high.
 Put a book or enchanted book into the enchantment side and you can select what enchantment you want to add to it! This will cost some tiers to work.
 More and stronger enchantments are available the higher the block's tier! But you cannot add more enchantments to books that have 3 or more enchantments already.
 You can grow the block's tiers even outside the GUI by dropping items into the block or letting experience orbs touch the block!
 Some items grant more progress towards upgrading the tiers. And when using tiers to enchant, some Honey Crystal Shards will drop!
 You can blacklist items from consumption, blacklist what enchantments are available, or change what items can be enchanted by tags:
 `the_bumblezone:crystalline_flower/cannot_consume` (item tag)
 `the_bumblezone:crystalline_flower/can_be_enchanted` (item tag)
 `the_bumblezone:crystalline_flower/xp_2_when_consumed` (item tag)
 `the_bumblezone:crystalline_flower/xp_5_when_consumed` (item tag)
 `the_bumblezone:crystalline_flower/xp_25_when_consumed` (item tag)
 `the_bumblezone:crystalline_flower/xp_100_when_consumed` (item tag)
 `the_bumblezone:blacklisted_crystalline_flower_enchantments` (enchantment tag)

Fixed Pile of Pollen, Sticky Honey Redstone, and Sticky Honey Residue blocking pistons when they should be destroyed on push.

##### Structures:
Added Hanging Gardens structure that you can find Crystalline Flower in!
 Be sure to look up! Can be found in Sugar Water Floor or Pollinated Fields biomes.

##### Biomes:
Fixed Pigs sometimes rarely spawning instead of Enderman.

Fixed Pollinated Fields and Pollinated Pillar sometimes placing the Pollen Piles on invalid blocks it cannot survive on.
