### **(V.7.4.8 Changes) (1.20.4 Minecraft)**

##### Config:
Added alternativeFluidToReplaceHoneyFluid config option to allow swapping Bumblezone Honey Fluid in worldgen with another fluid.
Give it the resourcelocation of the target fluid to swap to. You would still need to disable the Honey Bucket recipe yourself by datapack.

##### Lang:
Updated zh_cn (Special thanks to TskimiSeiran)


### **(V.7.4.7 Changes) (1.20.4 Minecraft)**

##### Structures:
Throne-locating Honey Compasses will now be marked if they are in inventory of a player entering the compass's located Throne Pillar structure.
 When an unmarked Throne-locating Honey Compasses is in bounds of a Throne Pillar structure without Bee Queen,
 the Bee Queen will be respawned and a Royal Jelly Fluid block restored farther above.
 Controlled by beeQueenRespawning config.
