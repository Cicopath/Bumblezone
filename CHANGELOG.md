### **(V.7.4.18 Changes) (1.20.1 Minecraft)**

##### Blocks:
Fixed named Honey Cocoon losing name when mined without Silk Touch.

##### Commands:
Added `/bumblezone_teleport <entity>` command where if used on any living entity, it'll teleport them to Bumblezone.
 If used on entities already in Bumblezone, it'll teleport them out.
 This is using the beehive teleporting mechanics behind the scenes.
 Requires op permission to use.
