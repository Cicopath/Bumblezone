##### Misc:
Fixed REI compat crashing servers

##### Entities:
Fixed Honey Slime and Beehemoth not spawning naturally for regular chunk generation.


### **(V.6.0.0 Changes) (1.19.0 Minecraft)**

##### Major:
Ported to 1.19! 
 NOTE: If you make a new world with Bumblezone on, you have to enter the world, exit, and then re-enter for custom dimensions to spawn.
 This is a Fabric bug that will be fixed when this is merged and released in Fabric API: https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric/pull/2345

##### Structures:
Biome mobs can spawn in Bumblezone's structures naturally now.

Cell Maze structure is now buried better.

Made boundary of Cell Maze tighter so that you only get Wrath of the Hive when it is obvious you are in a Cell maze structure.

Cell Maze structure is now much more spread out in the world.

##### Fluids:
Fixed bottom of honey fluid rendering when it shouldn't in some cases.
