<h2 style="color: #b76a00;"><strong>WHAT IS THE BUMBLEZONE?</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px;">&nbsp; &nbsp;The Bumblezone is a dimension filled with Honeycomb Blocks, Honey Blocks, and a new Porous Honeycomb Block that can be filled with Honey! The dimension itself looks like it is the inside of a bee nest! You will find giant walls in rows with canals of water between them along with giant columns providing support to the ceiling all over. The walls and columns are riddled with honeycomb holes. By default, traveling a block in this dimension is the same as traveling 10 block in the Overworld. (A movement factor of 10. For reference, the Nether has a movement factor of 8 so traveling a block in the Nether is the same as traveling 8 blocks in Overworld)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px;">&nbsp; &nbsp;But that isn't all! Within the dimension, bees are extremely protective of their honey. If you pick up a Honey Block, take honey from a Filled Porous Honeycomb block with a Glass Bottle, or you drink a Honey Bottle, all bees around you will get a speed, absorption, and strength potion effect and will become VERY angry at you! You will know you are in DEEP trouble when you get the Wrath of the Hive icon showing you got that effect and the fog in the dimension become more red! The bee will swarm you like crazy and will kill you unless you come very well prepared. A full set of unenchanted Diamond gear will not be enough. (but you can nerf the bees in the config if you find them too strong or buff them if you want to die!) Also, with the&nbsp;Filled Porous Honeycomb block, once you take honey from it, it turns into a Porous Honeycomb block but you can use a Honey Bottle on it to refill it back to being a Filled Porous Honeycomb block!</span></p>

<h2 style="color: #b76a00;"><strong>HOW DO I ENTER THIS WORLD?</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px;">&nbsp; &nbsp; Entering the dimension is super easy! Just throw an Enderpearl at a Bee Nest to enter inside it and spawn into the dimension. To teleport out of the dimension, you can either dig down and fall below Y = 0 (don't worry, you won't die as I made sure of that) or climb your way to above Y = 256. The mod will see you are trying to leave and it'll take your coordinates in The Bumblezone, convert it to the correct coordinate in the original dimension you came from and will try to place you in that dimension near a Bee Nest (or it'll create a new Bee Nest to place you next to if you does not find a Bee Nest already). Through normal use, you cannot use the mod to jump between dimensions but you can use it to travel long distances in any dimension you want. Just be sure to enter The Bumblezone from the dimension you want to fast travel in and then exiting The Bumblezone will put you back into that dimension.</span></p>

<h2 style="color: #b76a00;"><strong>HOW CAN I CONFIGURE THIS MOD?</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px;">&nbsp; &nbsp;To reach this mod's config file, go into your world's save folder, open the config folder, and edit the the_bumblezone.json5 file with an editor like Notepad to change the config. The config is read in real time so you should be able to change the config and see the changes in your world right away! However, I do not know how the config will behave on servers so let me know if that causes some issues.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px;">&nbsp; &nbsp;There are 12 config options currently for the mod. The first 4 affects the dimension and lets you control whether the dimension has a day/night cycle (that matches the Overworld's cycle), how bright the fog is, what the movement factor of the dimension is, and whether exiting the dimension will always place you back at Overworld instead of previous dimension you came from. The 8 other configs lets you customize the Wrath of the Hive effect so you can change how long it lasts, how far bees has to be to be angered and boosted, how strong the effects given to bees are, whether Wrath of the Hive can be triggered outside The Bumblezone, show particles of the effect, or just turn off the effect completely. Lots of options! Take a look at the config and let me know if there's anything config that would be super helpful for you to have with this mod. :)</span></p>
