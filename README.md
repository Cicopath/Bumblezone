<h2 style="color: #b76a00;"><strong>WHAT IS THE BUMBLEZONE?</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px;">&nbsp; The Bumblezone is a dimension filled with Honeycomb Blocks, Honey Blocks, Honey Crystals, Sugar Water, and few new bee-related Blocks! There's even a structure with unique bee armor you can obtain! The dimension itself looks like it is the inside of a bee nest and you will find giant walls in rows with canals of water between them along with giant columns providing support to the ceiling all over. Maybe you'll even find a pollen covered section of the dimension! The walls and columns are riddled with honeycomb holes. By default in the configs, entering Bumblezone will take your coordinates and divide it by 4 to get the new coordinates to spawn around at in Bumblezone dimension. When exiting Bumblezone, your coordinates will be multiplied by 4 and the game will look for a bee nest/beehive around that new coordinate in the target dimension. If it cannot find any bee nest/beehive to teleport you to, the game will teleport you to the original spot you were at in that dimension when you originally tried to enter Bumblezone. See the config file to change the teleportation mode.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px;">&nbsp; &nbsp;But that isn't all! Within the dimension, bees are extremely protective of their honey. If you mine a Honey Block, take honey from a Filled Porous Honeycomb block with a Glass Bottle, or you hit a bee, all bees around you will get a speed, absorption, and strength potion effect and will become VERY angry at you! You will know you are in DEEP trouble when you get the Wrath of the Hive icon showing you got that effect and the fog in the dimension become more red! The bee will swarm you like crazy and will kill you unless you come very well prepared. A full set of unenchanted Diamond gear will not be enough. (but you can nerf the bees in the config if you find them too strong or buff them if you want to die!) Also, with the&nbsp;Filled Porous Honeycomb block, once you take honey from it, it turns into a Porous Honeycomb block but you can use a Honey Bottle on it to refill it back to being a Filled Porous Honeycomb block! And you may find passive Honey Slime mobs hopping around that can be used as a farmable source of Honey Bottles as well!</span></p>
